# project-management
This is an issue-only repository, meant to track pilot-specific issues. ([See github recommendation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issues-only-repository) )   This will allow the Pilot to track milestones in a 
way that GitHub does not allow for non-repository projects. Issues that relate to the Pilot specifically will be tracked
here, and may contain links to issues in other repositories managed by teams across the Pilot.
